Password Generator

Desciption:

A password is generated based upon the criteria that the user provides.

When a user is prompted for a password they will then click on the button "Generate Password". They are then told to provide the correct information of how long the password will be. When prompted, they will choose between 8-50 characters in the length of range. The generator will then loop until the user enters a valid number.

Within the program is an array of numbers, characters, upper and lower case letters. The user is directed to choose between those. If the user chooses to select none to all of the criteria, the program will ask them to select atleast one and it will loop back through the prompts. The password will appear in the box once all of the parameters are met.
